# ARCSim 0.3.1 Fixes and Installer Script

This repository is a fork of ARCSim 0.3.1: Adaptive Refining and Coarsening Simulator, which you can also find [here](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/resources/ARCSim/). It contains bug fixes for the installation and an installer script.



## Instructions:

Open a terminal in the folder you would like to install ARCSim and paste the following commands:

1. Clone repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Juju-botu/arcsim.git && cd arcsim/
```

2. Change permissions and install:
```shell
sudo chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```
